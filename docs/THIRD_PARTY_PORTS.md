Mineradio's full desktop mode adapts the upstream idea of moving the existing
Electron main-window HWND between the Windows WorkerW desktop layer and an
interactive top-level window. The native attach/detach code in this project was
rewritten around the optimized edition's fail-closed WorkerW discovery, DPI
conversion, structured acknowledgements, serialized lifecycle, and cleanup
requirements.

The home dashboard adapts the upstream information hierarchy (continue,
library, daily recommendations, recent playback, today's listening, next up,
discovery, and radio entry points). Its data adapters use this project's current
multi-provider discovery, playlist, search, playback queue, and listen-history
state. Upstream LX-only server routes and the legacy standalone wallpaper
overlay were not copied.

The 2026-07-19 refresh additionally adapts the three-song "For You" strip,
stable cover-image swaps, in-place quick-card updates, daily-review hover
feedback, and compact-height scrolling/settings behavior. These features remain
implemented against Mineradio's existing provider, weather-radio, local-library,
queue, and playback modules rather than the upstream LX/local-only data model.

The combined application remains distributed under the repository's GNU GPL v3
license. Preserve this notice and the corresponding source when redistributing
modified builds.
